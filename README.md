# ReadQuest: Store, rate, and review your reads

Full-stack application that lets users track and rate what they have read. Users can create an account and store books in their "book shelf" where they can see and view past books they have read.

On the user's dashboard are three APIS:

- One which shows users the top 10 books according to the New York Times Bestsellers list
- A second API which genertes a random quote.
- And a third API that gets the weather in their area and tells them what day it will be a good day to read (Example: Rainy day in 3 days, great time to read!).
